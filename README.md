node-red-contrib-cip-ethernet-ip
=====================
A Node-RED node to interact with Allen Bradley / Rockwell PLCs using the EtherNet/IP protocol.
Based on the awesome work of [cmseaton42/node-ethernet-ip](https://github.com/cmseaton42/node-ethernet-ip).

This node was created by [Smart-Tech](https://netsmarttech.com) as part of the [ST-One](https://netsmarttech.com/page/st-one) project.

This is a work in progress. Please be cautious when communicating with PLCs in production. Feedback is always welcome!

TODO
----
 - Add new "control" node to call other PLC functions
   - Get/Set time
   - Get PLC Properties
 - All help sections
